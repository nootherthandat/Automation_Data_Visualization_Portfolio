My journey into automation began during my MS in Geomatics Engineering through the use of Model Management Systems. By mastering the QGIS ModelBuilder, I developed a node-based approach to problem-solving. This experience proved that the principles of automation are universal: the interface might change, but the logic and flow are the same. This perspective allows me to quickly master new automation platforms and build efficient workflows in any domain.
